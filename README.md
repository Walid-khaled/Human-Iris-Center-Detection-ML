## Human-Iris-Center-Detection-ML
This repository contains an implementation for calculating human iris center using CNN model built by PyTorch. The CNN architecture is proposed in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8803121/), and Dataset with face images and labels (iris center coordinates + eye corners) is [here](https://www.unavarra.es/gi4e/databases/gi4e/). It is apart of Assignment2 in Machine Learning course for ROCV master's program at Innopolis University.
